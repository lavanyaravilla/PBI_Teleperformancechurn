# PBI_Teleperformancechurn
Project Goal: To develop an interactive dashboard in Power BI that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer retention for a telecom company, enabling proactive retention strategies.

Background:

The telecom company recognizes the importance of customer retention and aims to move from a reactive (post-termination) approach to a proactive one. Previous attempts at customer analysis using Excel have been unsuccessful. The Retention Manager has requested a clear, self-explanatory dashboard to understand customer behavior and identify at-risk customers.

Background:

The telecom company recognizes the importance of customer retention and aims to move from a reactive (post-termination) approach to a proactive one. Previous attempts at customer analysis using Excel have been unsuccessful.
